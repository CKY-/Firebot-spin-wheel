# Firebot Spin Wheel Custom Script in Typescript

### Setup
1. Create a new repo based off this template (Click "Use this Template" above) or simply fork it
2. `npm install`

### Building
Dev:
1. `npm run build:dev`
- Automatically copies the compiled .js to Firebot's scripts folder.

Release:
1. `npm run build`
- Copy .js from `/dist`

### Note
- Keep the script definition object (that contains the `run`, `getScriptManifest`, and `getDefaultParameters` funcs) in the `index.ts` file as it's important those function names don't get minimized.
- Edit the `"scriptOutputName"` property in `package.json` to change the filename of the outputted script.

`pixelRatio`                    | `0`               | The pixel ratio used to render the wheel.</p><p>Values above 0 will produce a sharper image at the cost of performance.</p><p>A value of `0` will cause the pixel ratio to be automatically determined using `devicePixelRatio`.
`radius`                        | `0.95`            | The radius of the wheel (as a percent of the container's smallest dimension).
`rotation`                      | `0`               | The rotation (angle in degrees) of the wheel.</p><p>The first item will be drawn clockwise from this point.
`rotationResistance`            | `-35`             | The amount that `rotationSpeed` will be reduced by every second. Only in effect when `rotationSpeed !== 0`.</p><p>Set to `0` to spin the wheel infinitely.
`rotationSpeed`                 | `0`               | (Readonly) How far (angle in degrees) the wheel will spin every 1 second.</p><p>A positive number means the wheel is spinning clockwise, a negative number means anticlockwise, and `0` means the wheel is not spinning.
`rotationSpeedMax`              | `250`             | The maximum value for `rotationSpeed` (ignoring the wheel's spin direction).</p><p>The wheel will not spin faster than this value in any direction.
`offset`                        | `{w: 0, h: 0}`    | The offset of the wheel relative to it's center (as a percent of the wheel's diameter).
`overlayImage`                  | `''`              | The url of an image that will be drawn over the center of the wheel which will not rotate with the wheel.</p><p>It will be automatically scaled to fit the container's smallest dimension.</p><p>Use this to draw decorations around the wheel, such as a stand or pointer.
`pointerAngle`                  | `0`               | The angle of the Pointer which is used to determine the `currentIndex` (or the "winning" item).

------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------
`backgroundColor`               | `null`            | The background color of the item.</p><p>When `null`, the actual color rendered will fall back to `itemBackgroundColors`.</p><p>Example: `'#fff'`.
`image`                         | `null`            | The url of an image that will be drawn on the item. Any part of the image that extends outside the item will be clipped. The image will be drawn over the top of `backgroundColor`.
`imageOpacity`                  | `1`               | The opacity (as a percent) of `Item.image`. Useful if you want to fade the image to make the item's label stand out.
`imageRadius`                   | `0.5`             | The point along the radius (as a percent, starting from the center of the wheel) to draw the center of `Item.image`.

`label`                         | `''`              | The text that will be drawn on the item.
`labelColor`                    | `null`            | The color of the label.</p><p>When `null`, the actual color rendered will fall back to `itemLabelColors`.</p><p>Example: `'#000'`.
`value`                         | `null`            | Some value that has meaning to your application. For example, a reference to the object representing the item on the wheel, or a database id.
`weight`                        | `1`               | The proportional size of the item relative to other items on the wheel.</p><p>For example, if you have 2 items where `item[0]` has a weight of `1` and `item[1]` has a weight of `2`, then `item[0]` will take up 1/3 of the space on the wheel.
